## Hyper Pitch ##

Hyper Princess Pitch is a Daniel's Indegame.

The project proposes to contribute some new elements to Daniel's prototype.

According to Gamemaker, The IDE is a little rough so we cannot separate the scripts from the project. Therefore we upload all assets.

Development Notice:
- 
- Latest GameMaker Studio. It has been free for use, but only supported to publish on Windows.
- Referenceï¼š [Daniel's HOME](http://www.remar.se/daniel/pitch.php)

#### Notice: ####

There are too many init problems. It comes because gm5/gm7 counld auto_init, but tragedy happens when we migrate the game from 5/7 to gms.
Recently we are devoted to fix init problems.

#### TODO ####

1. var other.barrel is hard to fix all for obj_top collision. other stand for collision.
2. obj_snowpart gradually invades all pitch.
