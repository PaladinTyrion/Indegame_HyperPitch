## Hyper Pitch ##

Hyper Princess Pitch is a Daniel's Indegame.

The project proposes to contribute some new elements to Daniel's prototype.

According to Gamemaker, The IDE is a little rough so we cannot separate the scripts from the project. Therefore we upload all assets.

Development Notice:
- 
- Latest GameMaker Studio. It has been free for use, but only supported to publish on Windows.
- Reference： [Daniel's HOME](http://www.remar.se/daniel/pitch.php)
